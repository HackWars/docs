# HackWars 3.0

An open-source reimagining of the HackWars project, with a few goals in mind:

* a JavaScript, rather than a Java engine.
* JavaScript for scripting, rather than HackScript:
  * we can give [sandcastle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sandcastle), I'm sure we'll have to fix some security issues.
* a way to navigate the HackWars world that feels more like a traditional RPG
  * [RPG.js](http://rpgjs.com/) could be a great start.
* A better run, modern, open-source project.
