# HackWars 3.0

An open-source reimagining of the HackWars project, with a few goals in mind:

* a JavaScript, rather than a Java engine.
* JavaScript for scripting, rather than HackScript:
  * we can give [sandcastle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sandcastle), I'm sure we'll have to fix some security issues.
* a way to navigate the HackWars world that feels more like a traditional RPG.
* A better run, modern, open-source project.

## Building the HackWars World

Designing the world map:

* [tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) seems like an awesome tool for this.

Resource for free sprites:

* http://opengameart.org/

The following game-engines seem promising:

* https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser
* https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/
* https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS
  * bonus points, integrates with tiled.
